Learning github with hello-world 

Hello, my name is William Smith and my dream is to work for CGI. I am here on, August 11 2016, learning how to use Github.
I have a passion for computer programming and want to be the very best that I can possibly be. A highly skilled programmer.
I have a son named Liam. I love him more than anything and everything I do is for his future.
